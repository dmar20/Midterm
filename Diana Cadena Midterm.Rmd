#There is a exponential increase from 2000 to 2005 with a maximum greater than 350,000 #and it drops down between 2005 to around 2012 and slowly starts to increase again after #2012

#Diana Notes
#The boxplot tells us that the majority of the home sales are in the range from 200000 to # 300000, the max is over 350000, the min is under 150000 and the median is between #250000 and 300000. After looking at the summary stats, it give us a more precise #information, Min. 142900 Median 280200   Max. 373100
